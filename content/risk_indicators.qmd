### Coral bleaching stress

Accumulated heat stress, which can lead to coral bleaching and death, is measured by summing degree heating weeks for the most recent 12-week period from sea surface temperature data (cite). Bleaching stress was generally below average until the mid-2000s, until a sudden bleaching event in 2005 which is now the second most severe event in history. In 2024, and unprecedented bleaching event occurred across the U.S. Caribbean and beyond (@fig-DHW).
